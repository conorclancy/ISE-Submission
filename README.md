Introduction: 
For my Immersive software engineering submission, I wanted to see how code could be used to verify mathematical results from real world problems. When I discussed my interest in this course with my physics teacher Barry Ryan, he told me about this year’s applied mathematics portfolio submission of the rollercoaster. Although I don’t do applied mathematics as a subject, I thought it would be an interesting topic, while also being a challenge.  

I will be investigating the effects that different forces have on the movement of a rollercoaster, primarily the force of friction and the and how friction affects the forces that the passengers experience.

I thoroughly enjoyed the process of doing this project, it gave me an idea of what it was like to code and I leart how to resolve certain errors to do with coding such as a loop in my code and how to use the matplotlib feature with python. I'm proud of the python code I have completed as prior to this prject I had no coding knowledge and the maths that I completed throughout this project.
